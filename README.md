The student distribution website aims to save time and effort by facilitating student distribution for both Head of the department and the students in the faculty.
The website facilitates the formation of a student database for all students and their selections and it helps the head of department to view the student degrees and set a deadline for their submitting their selections and it calculates the minimum acceptance percentage for computer and communication department and it also sends a confirmation mail for the student after submitting his choice.

The Project idea is to distribute students among college departments based on their choice , their degree and the available seats for every department .

- head will set the deadline and percentage for every department
